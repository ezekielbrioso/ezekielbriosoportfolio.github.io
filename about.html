            <p>I'm Ezekiel Brioso, 18 years old, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
                My world revolves around designing multimedia, and I am dedicated to constantly learning and evolving in this dynamic field.
                I have a passion for screenwriting, storytelling, photography, video editing, and graphic design.<br>
                <br>
                My goal is to skillfully curate each of these artistic disciplines to craft visually appealing content that evokes meaningful connections and resonates with audiences. 
                I believe in pushing boundaries and experimenting with different techniques to create compelling narratives and impactful designs.
                Through my work, I aim to blend creativity with functionality, striving to produce content that not only looks great but also communicates effectively and leaves a lasting impression.</p>
